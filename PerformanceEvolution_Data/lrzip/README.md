# lrzip (pervolution)

## Case Study Information

- software: lrzip
- cluster: zeus
- benchmark/workload: compressing a 621 MB file generated with `uiq2 data 1 100000000` (http://mattmahoney.net/dc/uiq/)
- configurations: 1440
- revisions: 22
- properties:
  - performance (run time)
  - cpu (cpu load)
  - size (size of output file)
- notes:
  - 5 repetitions
  - < 10% relative standard deviation for properties performance and energy
  - We started beginning with v0.530 to also use the processor count

## Measurements Information

- average relative standard deviations:
  - performance: 1.84 %
- relative standard deviations available in separate files
- discretized results available
