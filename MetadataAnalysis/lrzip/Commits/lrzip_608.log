commit f496e0705dc7acdcca7524cbd2f1920911669d05

    get_sb only allows accessing one byte at a time, yet we don't need that functionality when sliding mmap is not in use.
    User different versions of the function and the larger memcpys depending on whether sliding mmap is in use or not.
    This affords a substantial speedup in the rzip phase of files not requiring sliding mmap.
    A small optimisation of moving the check for remapping the low buffer also speeds up the sliding mmap version slightly.
