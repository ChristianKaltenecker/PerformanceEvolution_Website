    Do not needlessly catch exceptions in Java bindings
    
    A lot of existing code in Java bindings catches exceptions just to
    silence them later.
    
    This is:
    a) Unnecessary: it is OK for a function to throw a Run[1;31mtime[mException
    without declaring it.
    b) Highly unidiomatic and not recommended by Java experts (see Effective
    Java and others)
    c) Confusing as has the potential to hide the existing bugs and have
    them resurface at the most inconvenient/unexpected moment.

    Implement a CMake build system.
    
    This is a large rework of my first attempt at this (#459).
    
    This implementation calls into the recently implemented python scripts
    to generate the necessary generated ``.h`` and ``.cpp`` files but is
    independent from Python building system otherwise.  Unlike the Python
    build system, the generated files are emitted into the build tree to
    avoid polluting the source tree. The build system is setup to refuse to
    configure if it detects generated files in the source tree. If your
    source tree is dirty you can run ``git clean -fx`` to clean your working
    directory.
    
    Currently the build succeeds on Linux using CMake 3.4.3 using
    the "Unix Makefiles" generator with gcc or clang.
    
    The following notable features are implemented:
    
    * Building of the C and C++ examples and the ``test-z3`` executable.
      These are included from the ``all`` target so you have to tell the
      build system (e.g. make) to build them manually.
    
    * Install (``make install``) and uninstall (``make uninstall``) of libz3
      and its header files. This supports ``DESTDIR`` out of the box because
      CMake supports it.
    
    * An option (``BUILD_LIBZ3_SHARED``) to build libz3 as a static or dynamic library.
    
    * Support for using/not using OpenMP (``USE_OPENMP``)
    
    * Support for using/not using libgmp (``USE_LIB_GMP``)
    
    * Setting the SOVERSION for libz3. I'm not sure if I'm setting the
    * number correctly though. This is required by Linux distrubtions that
      wills ship libz3. This needs discussion.
    
    The following notable features are currently not implemented
    and are left for future work.
    
    * Support for ARM.
    * Support for the foci2 library.
    * Support for creating/installing/uninstalling the dotnet, java, python and ml
      bindings.
    * Full support for MSVC. Although I've tried to write the CMake code
      with MSVC in mind not all the correct flags are passed to it.
    * Support for using the git hash.
    
    This new build system has several advantages other the old build system.
    
    * It is easier for outside contributors to contribute to Z3 when the
      build system is something more standard.
    * Incremental builds work properly. With the old build system when
      new code is pulled down the old build directory would need to thrown
      out and a new fresh build had to be performed because the build system
      didn't know how to correctly rebuild the project (e.g. couldn't handle
      new sources being added/removed, compiler flags changing, generated
      files changing, etc...). This is a MASSIVE boost to productivity!
    * We now have access rich array of features that CMake provides for
      building C/C++ projects. This means less [1;31mtime[m spent implementing
      custom build system logic in Python that is already supported by
      CMake.
    * CMake supports many IDEs out of the box so it should be fairly
      straight forward to build Z3 with Visual Studio (once support for MSVC
      is added), Xcode, Eclipse CDT, CLion, ..etc.

    Teach the OCaml bindings install rule to respect the DESTDIR makefile
    variable. Previously it would try to install into the system (e.g.
    ``/usr/lib/ocaml``) regardless of the value of DESTDIR.
    
    Unfortunately it looks like packagers who use DESTDIR to do staged
    installs will need to have their packages patch their user's OCaml
    ``ld.conf`` file manually at package install [1;31mtime[m (not ``make install``
    [1;31mtime[m) with the extra path to the Z3 Ocaml package directory. We could
    use the ``touch`` command to create an empty ``ld.conf`` before running
    ``ocamlfind install`` but that adds the wrong path to ``ld.conf``
    because it contains DESTDIR.

    Partially fix not being able to do a staged install (using ``DESTDIR``)
    when installing the Python bindings.
    
    If ``DESTDIR`` is set the bindings will now be installed under this
    path but ``$(PREFIX)`` only appears in the ``Makefile`` if ``--prefix``
    was set which seems a little broken (we'll fix this soon).
    
    The creation of the Python ``site-packages`` (and ``__pycache__`` for Python
    3) directories has been moved to build [1;31mtime[m instead of configure [1;31mtime[m

    Teach the build system to build and install the ".NET bindings"
    under non Windows systems (i.e. Using mono).
    
    Building these bindings is unfortunately on by default because
    I didn't want to change the command line interface (i.e. ``--nodotnet``)
    which people might be relying on. This should really be changed to
    match the other binding flags (e.g. ``--java``) but I will leave
    this for now.
    
    To [1;31mperf[morm the build a C# compiler and the GAC utility are required.
    The script will try to automatically detect them but the user can
    override this by setting the ``CSC`` and ``GACUTIL`` environment
    variables.
    
    In order for the ".NET bindings" to be installed the assembly
    (``Microsoft.Z3.dll``) needs to have a strong name which means
    we need a Strong name key file which is what the
    ``Microsoft.Z3.mono.snk`` is for. This is the public and private
    key so this key **must never** be used for checking integrity. Instead its
    only purpose is to avoid any name clashes in the GAC.
    
    It is also worth noting that slightly different flags needs to
    be passed to the C# compiler on non Windows platforms. I don't
    understand why some of the flags are being used on Windows but I left
    a comment there that hopefully someone can fix...
