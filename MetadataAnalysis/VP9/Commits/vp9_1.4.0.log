    Update to variance partition.
    
    Use force_split to constrain the partition selection.
    This is used because in the top-down approach to variance partition,
    a block size may be selected even though one of its subblocks may have
    high variance.
    
    In this patch the selection of the 64x64 block size will only
    be allowed if the variance of all the 32x32 subblocks are also below the threshold.
    
    Stil testing, but some visual improvement for areas near [1;31mslow[m moving boundary
    can be seen. Metrics for RTC set increase by about ~0.5%.

    Apply fast motion search to golden reference frame
    
    This commit enables the rtc coding mode to run integral projection
    based motion search for golden reference frame. It improves the
    speed -6 compression performance by 1.1% on average, 3.46% for
    jimred_vga, 6.46% for tacomascmvvga, and 0.5% for vidyo clips. The
    speed -6 is about 6% [1;31mslow[mer.

    Integral projection based motion estimation
    
    This commit introduces a new block match motion estimation
    using integral projection measurement. The 2-D block and the nearby
    region is projected onto the horizontal and vertical 1-D vectors,
    respectively. It then runs vector match, instead of block match,
    over the two separate 1-D vectors to locate the motion compensated
    reference block.
    
    This process is run per 64x64 block to align the reference before
    choosing partitioning in speed 6. The overall CPU cycle cost due
    to this additional 64x64 block match (SSE2 version) takes around 2%
    at low bit-rate rtc speed 6. When strong motion activities exist in
    the video sequence, it substantially improves the partition
    selection accuracy, thereby achieving better compression performance
    and lower CPU cycles.
    
    The experiments were tested in RTC speed -6 setting:

    Try again to merge branch 'frame-parallel' into master branch.
    
    In frame parallel decode, libvpx decoder decodes several frames on all
    cpus in parallel fashion. If not being flushed, it will only return frame
    when all the cpus are busy. If getting flushed, it will return all the
    frames in the decoder. Compare with current serial decode mode in which
    libvpx decoder is idle between decode calls, libvpx decoder is busy
    between decode calls.
    
    Current frame parallel decode will only speed up the decoding for frame
    parallel encoded videos. For non frame parallel encoded videos, frame
    parallel decode is [1;31mslow[mer than serial decode due to lack of loopfilter
    worker thread.
    
    There are still some known issues that need to be addressed. For example:
    decode frame parallel videos with segmentation enabled is not right sometimes.
    
    * frame-parallel:
      Add error handling for frame parallel decode and unit test for that.
      Fix a bug in frame parallel decode and add a unit test for that.
      Add two test vectors to test frame parallel decode.
      Add key frame seeking to webmdec and webm_video_source.
      Implement frame parallel decode for VP9.
      Increase the thread test range to cover 5, 6, 7, 8 threads.
      Fix a bug in adding frame parallel unit test.

    SSSE3 Optimization for Atom processors using new instruction selection and ordering
    
    The function vp9_filter_block1d16_h8_ssse3 uses the PSHUFB instruction which has a 3 cycle latency and [1;31mslow[ms execution when done in blocks of 5 or more on Atom processors.
    By replacing the PSHUFB instructions with other more efficient single cycle instructions (PUNPCKLBW + PUNPCHBW + PALIGNR) performance can be improved.
    In the original code, the PSHUBF uses every byte and is consecutively copied.
    This is done more efficiently by PUNPCKLBW and PUNPCHBW, using PALIGNR to concatenate the intermediate result and then shift right the next consecutive 16 bytes for the final result.
    
    For example:
    filter = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    Reg = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
    REG1 = PUNPCKLBW Reg, Reg = 0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7
    REG2 = PUNPCHBW Reg, Reg = 8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15
    PALIGNR REG2, REG1, 1 = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    
    This optimization improved the function performance by 23% and produced a 3% user level gain on 1080p content on Atom processors.
    There was no observed performance impact on Core processors (expected).

    adapt the adjustment limit for rate correction factor in RTC mode
    
    Rate correction factor is used to correct the estimated rate for any
    given quantizer, and feeds into rate control for quantizer selection.
    We make use of the actual bits used to calculate this rate correction
    factor with an adjustment limit to prevent over-adjustment.
    
    This commit adapts the adjustment limit to the difference between the
    estimated bits and the actual bits, allows the adjustment limit to vary
    between 0.125 (when estimate is close to actual) and 0.625 (when there
    is >10X factor off between estimated and actual bits). By doing this,
    the commit appears to have largely corrected two observed issues:
    1. Adjustment is too [1;31mslow[m when the actual bits used is way off from
    estimate due to the small adjustment limit.
    2. Extreme oscillating quantizer choices due to the feedback loop.

    Use normal rate_correction_factor for gf in CBR mode
    
    I0c5f010 changed to allow update golden reference buffer in CBR mode,
    this commit changes the use of rate_correction_factor for those frames
    to be aligned with the new usage. This commit attempts to solve two
    issues:
    
    a. Initialization of rate correction factor for Golden Frame
    Prior to this patch, even the regular inter frame has been update
    the rate correction factor based on content and encoding results,
    the first golden frame would still use the ininitialized value
    that can be way off.
    
    b. Allowing rate correction factor update to be slightly faster
    Prior to this patch, when the rate correction factor is off, the
    update to the factor is too [1;31mslow[m, the factor could not get close
    to a semi-correct value even after many frames.
    
    The commit helps all clips in psnr/ssim metric, but especially to
    a few clip in RTC set that rate correction was way off. For example
    thaloundeskmtgvga gained about .5dB for both overall/average psnr.

    Hybrid partition search for rtc coding mode
    
    This commit re-designs the recursive partition search scheme in
    rtc speed -5. It first checks if the current block is under cyclic
    refresh mode. If so, apply recursive partition search. Otherwise,
    perform sub-sampled pixel based partition selection. When the
    pre-selection finds the partition size should be 32x32 or above,
    use the partition size directly. Otherwise, apply partition search
    at nearby levels around the preset partition size.
    
    It is enabled in speed -5. The compression performance of rtc
    speed -5 is improved by 9.4%. Speed wise, the run-time goes [1;31mslow[mer
    from 1% to 10%.

    Decide the partitioning threshold from the variance histogram
    
    Before encoding a frame, calculate and store each 16x16 block's
    variance of source difference between last and current frame.
    Find partitioning threshold T for the frame from its variance
    histogram, and then use T to make partition decisions.
    
    Comparing with fixed 16x16 partitioning, rtc set test showed an
    overall psnr gain of 3.242%, and ssim gain of 3.751%. The best
    psnr gain is 8.653%.
    
    The overall encoding speed didn't change much. It got faster for
    some clips(for example, 12% speedup for vidyo1), and a little
    [1;31mslow[mer for others.
    
    Also, a minor modification was made in datarate unit test.

    Quality is generally a little up for speed 2.
    
    Speed 3 was similar to speed 4 but now positioned more

       (opsnr +3.7% ssim +6.8% across all sets)
    
    The code has been cleaned up a bit so that for each incremental

    Motion referenced partition search for non-RD coding flow
    
    This commit enables the non-RD mode decision coding flow to
    adaptively apply partition search in non-refresh frame, when the
    collocated block in previous frame suggests there might be a motion
    activity. It refactors the update_state_rt() function to support
    buffer swap of mode_info struct, thereby unifying the encoding
    stage across various non-RD coding modes.
    
    It provides 5% compression performance gains in speed -6 for rtc
    test set, at about 12% speed [1;31mslow[m down.

    Skip mode check when mv has been tested
    
    This commit allows the non-RD mode decision to skip mode RD modelling
    check, if the motion vector associated with the current mode is
    same as that of NEARESTMV mode. This makes speed -7 about 2% faster.

    Skip golden ref frame check when it is same as last ref frame
    
    When golden reference frame is refreshed, the next frame has both
    its last and golden reference frames point to the same reference
    frame in real-time coding mode. Experiments suggest that using
    two separate reference frames for frames right after golden refresh
    frame does not provide further compression performance advantage.
    This commit hence retains the current encoder implementation and
    shuts off the mode search over golden reference frame in this case.

    Integral projection based motion estimation
    
    This commit introduces a new block match motion estimation
    using integral projection measurement. The 2-D block and the nearby
    region is projected onto the horizontal and vertical 1-D vectors,
    respectively. It then runs vector match, instead of block match,
    over the two separate 1-D vectors to locate the motion compensated
    reference block.
    
    This process is run per 64x64 block to align the reference before
    choosing partitioning in speed 6. The overall CPU cycle cost due
    to this additional 64x64 block match (SSE2 version) takes around 2%
    at low bit-rate rtc speed 6. When strong motion activities exist in
    the video sequence, it substantially improves the partition
    selection accuracy, thereby achieving better compression performance
    and lower CPU cycles.
    
    The experiments were tested in RTC speed -6 setting:

    Merge branch 'frame-parallel' to enable frame parallel decode in master branch.
    
    In frame parallel decode, libvpx decoder decodes several frames on all
    cpus in parallel fashion. If not being flushed, it will only return frame
    when all the cpus are busy. If getting flushed, it will return all the
    frames in the decoder. Compare with current serial decode mode in which
    libvpx decoder is idle between decode calls, libvpx decoder is busy
    between decode calls. VP9 frame parallel decode is >30% [1;31mfast[mer than serial
    decode with tile parallel threading which will makes devices play 1080P

    Use normal rate_correction_factor for gf in CBR mode
    
    I0c5f010 changed to allow update golden reference buffer in CBR mode,
    this commit changes the use of rate_correction_factor for those frames
    to be aligned with the new usage. This commit attempts to solve two
    issues:
    
    a. Initialization of rate correction factor for Golden Frame
    Prior to this patch, even the regular inter frame has been update
    the rate correction factor based on content and encoding results,
    the first golden frame would still use the ininitialized value
    that can be way off.
    
    b. Allowing rate correction factor update to be slightly [1;31mfast[mer
    Prior to this patch, when the rate correction factor is off, the
    update to the factor is too slow, the factor could not get close
    to a semi-correct value even after many frames.
    
    The commit helps all clips in psnr/ssim metric, but especially to
    a few clip in RTC set that rate correction was way off. For example
    thaloundeskmtgvga gained about .5dB for both overall/average psnr.

    The neon [1;31mfast[m quantizer has been moved to intrinsics. The armv6 version

    Implement frame parallel decode for VP9.
    
    Using 4 threads, frame parallel decode is ~3x [1;31mfast[mer than single thread
    decode and around 30% [1;31mfast[mer than tile parallel decode for frame parallel
    encoded video on both Android and desktop with 4 threads. Decode speed is
    scalable to threads too which means decode could be even [1;31mfast[mer with more threads.

    Subpel search cleanups and enhancements
    
    - Some fixes to surface fit.
    - Returns variance function as cost rather than sad in the
      pattern search and diamond search functions. Only
      vp9_pattern_search_sad function used in bigdia search
      uses sad as integer 1-away costs.
    - Deploys SUBPEL_TREE_PRUNED_MORE for speed 4+.
    
    Results:

    Decide the partitioning threshold from the variance histogram
    
    Before encoding a frame, calculate and store each 16x16 block's
    variance of source difference between last and current frame.
    Find partitioning threshold T for the frame from its variance
    histogram, and then use T to make partition decisions.
    
    Comparing with fixed 16x16 partitioning, rtc set test showed an
    overall psnr gain of 3.242%, and ssim gain of 3.751%. The best
    psnr gain is 8.653%.
    
    The overall encoding speed didn't change much. It got [1;31mfast[mer for
    some clips(for example, 12% speedup for vidyo1), and a little
    slower for others.
    
    Also, a minor modification was made in datarate unit test.

    Refactoring motion search libs
    
    The core motion estimation fucntions all return sad now consistently.
    The only exception is vp9_full_pixel_diamond(), however the core diamond
    and refining search routines called from vp9_full_pixel_diamond() also
    return SAD. If variance of pred error + mv cost is desired it must be
    calculated explicitly outside these functions. For very [1;31mfast[m encoding,
    hopefully this will eliminate some redundant computations.
    
    Also suggests reimplementing FAST_HEX with the vp9_pattern_search
    framework. It is not exactly the same as the existing FAST_HEX, but

    Enable reduced set of intra modes in rtc coding
    
    This commit enables the use of DC, vertical, and horizontal intra
    prediction mode in rtc non-RD mode decision. When the best cost value
    of inter modes is above a given threshold, the encoder runs the
    above three intra modes and selects the one that has minimum
    prediction residual in terms of SAD.
    
    This together with recent changes on non-RD mode decision and coding
    control improves compression performance of speed -6 by
    derf  91%
    yt    61%
    hd    46%
    stdhd 52%
    
    In terms of encoding speed, it is about 3 times [1;31mfast[mer than speed -5.

    Use [1;31mfast[m HEX search in real time mode
    
    In good quality mode motion search, the best matches are normally
    found after searching in a large area. In real time mode, to make
    encoding [1;31mfast[m, a center-biased [1;31mfast[m HEX search is used, which
    converges quickly most of the time. A 4-point diamond search is
    also carried out as the following refining search, which gives more
    precise results, and maintains good motion search quality.
    
    At speed 5, the borg test on rtc set showed an overall PSNR loss of
    0.936%. The encoding speed gain is 4% - 5%.

    This patch only works if the video is a width and height that are both

    Now 20% slower but adds motion search ( every block ), nearest, near

    bad quality albeit quickly, it isn't obeying all the rules it should
    about which frames are available.

    Optimze inv 16x16 DCT with 10 non-zero coeffs - P1
    
    This commit is the first patch optimizing SSE2 implementation of inverse
    16x16 DCT with <10 non-zero coefficients. It focused on the first 1-D (row)
    transformation. It exploits the fact that only top-left 4x4 block contains
    non-zero coefficients, in a 2-D inverse 16x16 DCT with <10 coeffients.
    
    The average runtime of idct16x16_10 unit is reduced from
    883 cycles -> 779 cycles (12% [1;31mfast[mer).
    
    For pedestrian_area_1080p 300 frames at 4000 kbps, the speed 2 runtime goes
    down from 310651 ms  -> 305910 ms. The decoding speed goes up from
    80.37 fps -> 80.87 fps.

    Account for chroma component costs in RTC mode decision
    
    This commit allows the encoder to account for additional chroma
    plane costs in the mode decision process, if the current block
    potentially contains significant color change. It improves the
    visual quality at very low bit-rates.
    
    The compression performance of dark720p is improved by 12.39% in
    speed 6. For jimred at 150 kbps, the PSNR of V component (red)
    increased by 0.2 dB, at the expense of about 5% increase in
    encoding [1;31mtime[m. Note that for sequences where the chroma components
    are fairly consistent, the encoding [1;31mtime[m increase is negligible.
    
    On average the rtc set compression performance is improved by
    1.172% in PSNR and 1.920% in SSIM.

    between decode calls.
    
    Current frame parallel decode will only speed up the decoding for frame
    parallel encoded videos. For non frame parallel encoded videos, frame
    parallel decode is slower than serial decode due to lack of loopfilter
    worker thread.

    vp9_ethread: add parallel loopfilter
    
    1. Added row-based loopfilter in encoder;
    2. Moved common multi-threaded loopfilter functions from decoder
       to common;
    3. Merged multi-threaded loopfilter code, and made encoder/
       decoder call same function to reduce code duplication.
    
    Encoder tests showed that 1% - 2% speedup was seen for good-quality
    2-pass mode(at speed 3); 1% - 3% speedup using 2 threads and 4% - 6%
    speedup using 4 threads were seen for real-[1;31mtime[m mode(at speed 7).

    Remove reset mode_info array per frame
    
    The mode_info array was unnecessarily reset to zero every frame
    when error resilient mode turned on, given that the mode info
    values per block will be assigned during mode search stage.
    
    This commit removes this reset operation. It reduces the run[1;31mtime[m

    Improve motion detection for low complexity regions.
    
    Where there is very subtle motion, especially when combined
    with low spatial complexity, the codec some[1;31mtime[ms fails to quickly
    pick up the ambient motion field.
    
    Once it has been established though the field propagates well using
    Nearest and Near MV.
    
    This patch looks specifically at the case where the Nearest and Near
    have not been established as non zero vectors and in this case
    discounts the cost of searching for a new vector in the rd code.
    
    This will almost certainly have some implications in terms of encode
    speed but it should be possible to mitigate the impact in a subsequent
    using first pass stats and the local spatial complexity.
    
    Average results for test sets approximately neutral.

    vp9_ethread: the tile-based multi-threaded encoder
    
    Currently, VP9 supports column-tile encoding, which allows a frame
    to be encoded in multiple column tiles independently. The number of
    column tiles are set by encoder option "--tile-columns". This
    provides a way to encode a frame in parallel.
    
    Based on previous set of patches, this patch implemented the tile-
    based multi-threaded encoder. Each thread processes one or more
    tiles.
    
    Usage:
    For HD clips:
    --tile-columns=2 --threads=1/2/3/4
    
    While using 4 threads, tests showed that the encoder achieved
    2.3X - 2.5X speedup at good-quality speed 3, and 2X speedup at
    real[1;31mtime[m speed 5.

    It is of particular benefit to light change scenarios. The
    compression performance of test clip mmmovingvga.y4m is improved by
    6.39% and 15.69% at high bit rates for speed -5 and -6, respectively.

    Hybrid partition search for rtc coding mode
    
    This commit re-designs the recursive partition search scheme in
    rtc speed -5. It first checks if the current block is under cyclic
    refresh mode. If so, apply recursive partition search. Otherwise,
    perform sub-sampled pixel based partition selection. When the
    pre-selection finds the partition size should be 32x32 or above,
    use the partition size directly. Otherwise, apply partition search
    at nearby levels around the preset partition size.
    
    It is enabled in speed -5. The compression performance of rtc
    speed -5 is improved by 9.4%. Speed wise, the run-[1;31mtime[m goes slower
    from 1% to 10%.

    Remove memset of every external frame buffer.
    
    Libvpx was memseting every external frame buffer before decode. This

    Removing alg_priv from vpx_codec_priv struct.
    
    In order to understand memory layout consider the declaration of the
    following structs. The first one is a part of our API:
    
    struct vpx_codec_ctx {
      // ...
      struct vpx_codec_priv *priv;
    };
    
    The second one is defined in vpx_codec_internal.h:
    
    struct vpx_codec_priv {
      // ...
    };
    
    The following struct is defined 4 [1;31mtime[ms for encoder/decoder VP8/VP9:
    
    struct vpx_codec_alg_priv {
      struct vpx_codec_priv base;
      // ...
    };
    
    Private data allocation for the given ctx:
    
    struct vpx_codec_ctx *ctx = <get>
    struct vpx_codec_alg_priv *alg_priv = <allocate>
    ctx->priv = (struct vpx_codec_priv *)alg_priv;
    
    The cast works because vpx_codec_alg_priv has a
    vpx_codec_priv instance as a first member 'base'.

    masked out to avoid computation.

    configure: add --enable-coefficient-range-checking
    
    This commit adds a configure [1;31mtime[m option used to enable strict error
    checking in decoder to make sure intermediate stage cofficients of
    inverse transforms are within valid range of signed 16 bit integer.
    
    For valid VP9 input streams, intermediate stage coefficients should
    always stay within the range of a signed 16 bit integer. Coefficients
    can go out of this range for invalid/corrupt VP9 streams. However,
    strictly checking this range for every intermediate coefficient can
    be a burden for decoder, therefore such validation is only enabled
    with configure option --enable-coefficient-range-checking.

    Chessboard pattern partition search
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern constrained partition
    search for 720p and above resolutions. The scheme applies stricter
    partition search to alternative blocks based on its above/left
    neighboring blocks' partition range, as well as that of the
    collocated blocks in the previous frame. It is currently turned
    on at 16x16 block size level. The chessboard pattern is flipped
    per coding frame.
    
    The speed 3 run[1;31mtime[m is reduced:
    park_joy_1080p, 652832 ms -> 607738 ms (7% speed-up)
    pedestrian_area_1080p, 215998 ms -> 200589 ms (8% speed-up)

    Enable chessboard inter prediction filter type search
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern prediction filter type
    search scheme for rate-distortion optimization speed-up. For the
    inferred motion vector modes, the encoder can re-use its above/left
    neighbor blocks' prediction filter type and skip a full test on

    most probable predicted motion vector. If it finds the two have
    the same motion vectors, it then skip finding exterior range for
    the second most probable motion vector, and correspondingly skips
    the check for NEARMV.
    
    The run[1;31mtime[m of speed -5 goes down

    vidyo at 720p       11830 ms -> 10990 ms
    i.e., 6%-8% speed-up.
    
    For rtc set, the compression performance
    goes down by about -1.3% for both speed -5 and -6.

    Reuse inter prediction result in real-[1;31mtime[m speed 6
    
    In real-[1;31mtime[m speed 6, no partition search is done. The inter
    prediction results got from picking mode can be reused in the
    following encoding process. A speed feature reuse_inter_pred_sby
    is added to only enable the resue in speed 6.
    
    This patch doesn't change encoding result. RTC set tests showed
    that the encoding speed gain is 2% - 5%.

    Fast computation path for forward transform and quantization
    
    This commit enables a fast path computational flow for forward
    transformation. It checks the sse and variance of prediction
    residuals and decides if the quantized coefficients are all
    zero, dc only, or more. It then selects the corresponding coding
    path in the forward transformation and quantization stage.
    
    It is currently enabled in rtc coding mode. Will do it for rd
    coding mode next.
    
    In speed -6, the run[1;31mtime[m for pedestrian_area 1080p at 1000 kbps
    goes down from 14234 ms to 13704 ms, i.e., about 4% speed-up.

    Add mode info arrays and mode info index.
    
    In non frame-parallel decoding, this works the same way as
    current decoding scheme. Every [1;31mtime[m after decoder finish
    decoding a frame, it will swap the current mode info pointer
    and  previous mode info pointer if the decoded frame needs
    to be shown. Both mode info pointer and previous mode info
    pointer are from mode info arrays.
    
    In frame-parallel decoding, this will become more complicated
    as current frame's mode info pointer will be shared with next
    frame as previous mode info pointer. But when one decoder
    thread finishes decoding one frame and starts to work on next
    available frame, it needs to retain the decoded frame's mode
    info pointers until next frame finishes decoding. The mode info
    index will serve this purpose. The decoder will use different
    buffer in the mode info arrays and use the other buffer to save
    previous decoded frame’s mode info.

    Use small transform size in non-rd real-[1;31mtime[m mode
    
    In non-rd real-[1;31mtime[m mode, choosing smaller transform size in
    encoding gives better video quality and good speed gain than
    choosing larger transform size. This patch set tx size search
    method to ALLOW_8X8, which is better than using 4x4 or other
    larger sizes.
    
    Borg tests on rtc set at speed 6 showed significant gain on quality.
    PSNR gain: 11.034% and SSIM gain: 15.466%.
    
    The speed gain is 5% - 12% for <720p clips, and 2% - 7% for

    This commit changed to enable the encoder to adjust motion dection
    speed threshold based on picture size. In addition, cpu-used 1 now
    does a partition search every other frame instead of every third
    frame for low resolution inputs.
    
    The change has no quality/speed impact for 720p and above. Test
    showed the change increase encoding [1;31mtime[m by between 3% to 6% for
    cpu-used 2 encodiong of 360p sequences. It also has a compression
    gain about .3%.
    
    For cpu-used 2, the change resolved some very disturbing visual
    artifacts in certain sequences when large block partitionings and
    transforms are used as a result of copying the partition from a
    previous frame.

    Enable variable block size test in non-RD mode decision
    
    This is an initial attempt to allow variable block size partition
    in non-RD coding flow. It tests 8x8, 16x16 and 32x32 block size per
    64x64 block, all using non-RD mode decision and the associated rate
    distortion costs from modeling, then selects the best block size to
    encode the entire 64x64 block. Such operations are triggered every
    other 3 frames. The blocks of intermediate frames will reuse the
    collocated block's partition type.
    
    It improves the compression performance by 13.2%. Note that the gains

    Enable reduced set of intra modes in rtc coding
    
    This commit enables the use of DC, vertical, and horizontal intra
    prediction mode in rtc non-RD mode decision. When the best cost value
    of inter modes is above a given threshold, the encoder runs the
    above three intra modes and selects the one that has minimum
    prediction residual in terms of SAD.
    
    This together with recent changes on non-RD mode decision and coding
    control improves compression performance of speed -6 by
    derf  91%
    yt    61%
    hd    46%
    stdhd 52%
    
    In terms of encoding speed, it is about 3 [1;31mtime[ms faster than speed -5.

    Use fast HEX search in real [1;31mtime[m mode
    
    In good quality mode motion search, the best matches are normally
    found after searching in a large area. In real [1;31mtime[m mode, to make
    encoding fast, a center-biased fast HEX search is used, which
    converges quickly most of the [1;31mtime[m. A 4-point diamond search is
    also carried out as the following refining search, which gives more
    precise results, and maintains good motion search quality.
    
    At speed 5, the borg test on rtc set showed an overall PSNR loss of
    0.936%. The encoding speed gain is 4% - 5%.

    Enable encode_breakout in real [1;31mtime[m encoding
    
    In real [1;31mtime[m encoding, we enable encode_breakout to make encoding
    fast. A speed feature "use_encode_breakout" is defined to set
    encode_breakout thresholds for different speeds.
    
    However, currently, static_thresh is an encoder option. The encode_
    breakout can be turned off if user sets static_thresh=0 specifically.
    
    The rtc set borg test result: (need to set --static_thresh=1)
    speed -5, psnr loss -3.543%;
    speed -4, psnr loss -2.358%;
    speed -3, psnr loss -0.771%.

    This commit is the first patch optimizing SSE2 implementation of inverse

    Support for extended feature flags enumeration leaf in CPUID instruction
    
    This CL fixes an overcite with the AVX2 support CL previously
    merged (Change-Id: Idc03f3fca4bf2d0afd33631ea1d3caf8fc34ec29) that
    prevented run[1;31mtime[m execution of AVX2 code in WebM.
    
    Background:
    Starting with the Sandybridge processor, the CPUID instruction was
    enhanced to add various extended feature flag enumeration leaves.
    Reading these leaves requires an additional input value for the CPUID
    instruction which is stored in ECX. This change adds this second input
    value for all ARCH_X86 and ARCH_x86_64 targets to the CPUID macros,
    allowing checks of EBX bit 5 for AVX2 support. This capability will be
    required moving forward to check for future processor features.

    Skip golden ref frame check when it is same as last ref frame
    
    When golden reference frame is refreshed, the next frame has both
    its last and golden reference frames point to the same reference
    frame in real-time coding mode. Experiments suggest that using
    two separate reference frames for frames right after golden refresh
    frame does not provide further compression [1;31mperf[mormance advantage.
    This commit hence retains the current encoder implementation and
    shuts off the mode search over golden reference frame in this case.

    Integral projection based motion estimation
    
    This commit introduces a new block match motion estimation
    using integral projection measurement. The 2-D block and the nearby
    region is projected onto the horizontal and vertical 1-D vectors,
    respectively. It then runs vector match, instead of block match,
    over the two separate 1-D vectors to locate the motion compensated
    reference block.
    
    This process is run per 64x64 block to align the reference before
    choosing partitioning in speed 6. The overall CPU cycle cost due
    to this additional 64x64 block match (SSE2 version) takes around 2%
    at low bit-rate rtc speed 6. When strong motion activities exist in
    the video sequence, it substantially improves the partition
    selection accuracy, thereby achieving better compression [1;31mperf[mormance
    and lower CPU cycles.
    
    The experiments were tested in RTC speed -6 setting:

    Account for chroma component costs in RTC mode decision
    
    This commit allows the encoder to account for additional chroma
    plane costs in the mode decision process, if the current block
    potentially contains significant color change. It improves the
    visual quality at very low bit-rates.
    
    The compression [1;31mperf[mormance of dark720p is improved by 12.39% in
    speed 6. For jimred at 150 kbps, the PSNR of V component (red)
    increased by 0.2 dB, at the expense of about 5% increase in
    encoding time. Note that for sequences where the chroma components
    are fairly consistent, the encoding time increase is negligible.
    
    On average the rtc set compression [1;31mperf[mormance is improved by
    1.172% in PSNR and 1.920% in SSIM.

    SSSE3 Optimization for Atom processors using new instruction selection and ordering
    
    The function vp9_filter_block1d16_h8_ssse3 uses the PSHUFB instruction which has a 3 cycle latency and slows execution when done in blocks of 5 or more on Atom processors.
    By replacing the PSHUFB instructions with other more efficient single cycle instructions (PUNPCKLBW + PUNPCHBW + PALIGNR) [1;31mperf[mormance can be improved.
    In the original code, the PSHUBF uses every byte and is consecutively copied.
    This is done more efficiently by PUNPCKLBW and PUNPCHBW, using PALIGNR to concatenate the intermediate result and then shift right the next consecutive 16 bytes for the final result.
    
    For example:
    filter = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    Reg = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
    REG1 = PUNPCKLBW Reg, Reg = 0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7
    REG2 = PUNPCHBW Reg, Reg = 8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15
    PALIGNR REG2, REG1, 1 = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    
    This optimization improved the function [1;31mperf[mormance by 23% and produced a 3% user level gain on 1080p content on Atom processors.
    There was no observed [1;31mperf[mormance impact on Core processors (expected).

    Vidyo: Support for one-pass rc-enabled SVC encoder
    
    Adds support for one-pass rc-enabled SVC encoder with callbacks for
    getting per-layer packets.
    - the callback function registration is implemented as an encoder
    control function.
    - if the callback function is not registered, the old way of
    aggregating packets with su[1;31mperf[mrame will take effect.
    - one more control function “VP9E_GET_SVC_LAYER_ID” has been
    implemented to get the temporal/spatial id from the encoder
    within the callback. This can be used to get the ids to put on RTP
    packet.

    improvements in intrinsics.
    
    Source files will remain until the various third-party builds are updated.
    
    The neon fast quantizer has been moved to intrinsics. The armv6 version
    has been removed because so few remaining targets require it.
    
    Compilers and processors have improved significantly since the
    pack_tokens code was written. The assembly is no longer faster than the
    C code.
    
    pack_tokens were the only optimizations for the armv5te targets so the targets
    will be removed after the test infrastructure has been updated.

    Rework partition search skip scheme
    
    This commit enables the encoder to skip split partition search if
    the bigger block size has all non-zero quantized coefficients in low
    frequency area and the total rate cost is below a certain threshold.
    It logarithmatically scales the rate threshold according to the
    current block size. For speed 3, the compression [1;31mperf[mormance loss:
    derf  -0.093%
    stdhd -0.066%
    
    Local experiments show 4% - 20% encoding speed-up for speed 3.

    Remove memset of every external frame buffer.
    
    Libvpx was memseting every external frame buffer before decode. This
    was to work around a valgrind issue in our C loop filter. Most of
    the time this was not needed and we have noticed some significant
    [1;31mperf[mormance loss on some platforms. Now we require the application to
    zero out the buffers if it is using external frame buffers.

    Fix invalid memory access on 2x downscale.
    
    The issue was discovered on bitstream with 2x vertical downscale. For
    zero MVs, y_pad is set to 1 only when vertical convolution is
    required. The original code assumes that for y_step_q4 == 32 we don't
    [1;31mperf[morm vertical convolution. But vp9_setup_scale_factors_for_frame()
    sets convolve functions so that when x_step and y_step are both not
    equal to 16, convolve in both directions is [1;31mperf[mormed. And convolve()
    unconditionally subtracts one stride from source pointer when calls
    convolve_horiz(). This leads to invalid memory access.

    Add a speed feature to give the tighter partition search
    range. Before partition search, calculate the histogram
    of the partition sizes of the left, above and previous
    co-located blocks of the current block. If the variance of
    observed partition sizes is small enough, adjust the search
    range around the mean partition size, which will be tigher.

    in partition search, therefore skip searching NONE. It
    computes a score which measures whether 16x16 motion vectors
    from the first pass in the current block are consistent with
    each others. If they are inconsistent and we have enough Q
    to encode, split the block directly, and skip searching NONE.
    
    This feature is under flag CONFIG_FP_MB_STATS. In speed 2,
    it further gives a speedup of 3-8% on sample yt clips as
    compared to the previous version under the same flag. Overall,
    the features under the flag will give 7-15% on typical yt
    clips at up to 6000kbps data rate. The speedup at very high
    data rate is not significant.
    
    For hard stdhd clips:
    park_joy_1080p @ 15000kbps:       504541ms -> 506293ms (-0.35%)
    pedestrian_area_1080p @ 2000kbps: 326610ms -> 290090ms (+11.2%)
    
    The compression [1;31mperf[mormance using the features under the flag:
    derf: -0.068%
    yt:   -0.189%
    hd:   -0.318%
    stdhd:-0.183%
    
    To use the feature, set CONFIG_FP_MB_STATS and turn on
    cpi->use_fp_mb_stats.

    Early termination after partition NONE is done in RD.
    
    This patch allows the encoder to skip the search for partition
    SPLIT, HORZ, VERT after the search for partition NONE is done
    in RD optimization. It uses the first pass block-wise statistics
    to make the decision. If all 16x16 blocks in the current partition
    have zero motions and small residues from the frist pass statistics,
    and it has small difference variance, further partition search is
    skipped.
    
    For speed 2 setting, experiments on general youtube clips show that
    the speedup varies from 1% - 10%, 5% on average. On the [1;31mperf[mormance
    side in PSNR, derf 0.004%, yt -0.059%, hd -0.106%, stdhd 0.032%.

    pedestrian_area_1080p, 227049 ms -> 220531 ms (+3%)
    
    This feature is under the compilation flag CONFIG_FP_MB_STATS and

    Chessboard pattern partition search
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern constrained partition
    search for 720p and above resolutions. The scheme applies stricter
    partition search to alternative blocks based on its above/left
    neighboring blocks' partition range, as well as that of the
    collocated blocks in the previous frame. It is currently turned
    on at 16x16 block size level. The chessboard pattern is flipped
    per coding frame.
    
    The speed 3 runtime is reduced:
    park_joy_1080p, 652832 ms -> 607738 ms (7% speed-up)
    pedestrian_area_1080p, 215998 ms -> 200589 ms (8% speed-up)

    This commit extends the chessboard pattern prediction filter search.
    If the above and left blocks have the same prediction filter type,
    the encoder will skip the prediction filter type search and use the

    Enable chessboard inter prediction filter type search
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern prediction filter type
    search scheme for rate-distortion optimization speed-up. For the
    inferred motion vector modes, the encoder can re-use its above/left
    neighbor blocks' prediction filter type and skip a full test on
    all possible filter types. Such operation is turned on/off
    alternatively in a chessboard manner.
    
    It is turned on in speed 3. For test clip pedestrian 1080p, the

    Add su[1;31mperf[mrame support for frame parallel decoding.
    
    A su[1;31mperf[mrame is a bunch of frames that bundled as one frame. It is mostly
    used to combine one or more non-displayable frames and one displayable frame.
    
    For frame parallel decoding, libvpx decoder will only support decoding one
    normal frame or a super frame with su[1;31mperf[mrame index.
    
    If an application pass a su[1;31mperf[mrame without su[1;31mperf[mrame index or a chunk
    of displayable frames without su[1;31mperf[mrame index to libvpx decoder, libvpx
    will not decode it in frame parallel mode. But libvpx decoder still could
    decode it in serial mode.

    Separate rate-distortion modeling for DC and AC coefficients
    
    This is the first step to rework the rate-distortion modeling used
    in rtc coding mode. The overall goal is to make the modeling
    customized for the statistics encountered in the rtc coding.
    
    This commit makes encoder to [1;31mperf[morm rate-distortion modeling for
    DC and AC coefficients separately. No speed changes observed.
    The coding [1;31mperf[mormance for pedestrian_area_1080p is largely
    improved:
    
    speed -5, from 79558 b/f, 37.871 dB -> 79598 b/f, 38.600 dB
    speed -6, from 79515 b/f, 37.822 dB -> 79544 b/f, 38.130 dB

    skip the un-necessary motion search in the first pass
    
    This patch allows the VP9 encoder to skip the un-necessary
    motion search in the first pass. It computes the motion error
    of 0,0 motion using the last source frame as the reference,
    and skips the further motion search if this error is small.
    
    Borg test shows overall the patch gives PSNR gain (derf -0.001%,
    yt 0.341%, hd 0.282%). Individual clips may have PSNR gain or
    loss. The best PSNR [1;31mperf[mormance is 7.347% and the worst is -0.662%.
    The first pass encoding speedup for slideshow clips is over 30%.

    Fast computation path for forward transform and quantization
    
    This commit enables a fast path computational flow for forward
    transformation. It checks the sse and variance of prediction
    residuals and decides if the quantized coefficients are all
    zero, dc only, or more. It then selects the corresponding coding
    path in the forward transformation and quantization stage.
    
    It is currently enabled in rtc coding mode. Will do it for rd
    coding mode next.
    
    In speed -6, the runtime for pedestrian_area 1080p at 1000 kbps
    goes down from 14234 ms to 13704 ms, i.e., about 4% speed-up.

    skip un-neccessary motion search in the first pass
    
    This patch allows the encoder to skip the
    un-neccessary motion search in the first pass. It
    calculates the error of the zero motion vector using
    the last source frame as reference and skips the
    further motion search in the first pass if the error
    is small.
    
    The encoding speedup of the first pass for slideshow

    Enable variable block size test in non-RD mode decision
    
    This is an initial attempt to allow variable block size partition
    in non-RD coding flow. It tests 8x8, 16x16 and 32x32 block size per
    64x64 block, all using non-RD mode decision and the associated rate
    distortion costs from modeling, then selects the best block size to
    encode the entire 64x64 block. Such operations are triggered every
    other 3 frames. The blocks of intermediate frames will reuse the
    collocated block's partition type.
    
    It improves the compression [1;31mperf[mormance by 13.2%. Note that the gains
    are not evenly distributed. For many hard clips, the compression
    [1;31mperf[mormance is improved by 20% to 28%. Local speed test shows that
    it will also increase runtime by 50%, as compared to speed -7. It is

    Refactoring motion search libs
    
    The core motion estimation fucntions all return sad now consistently.
    The only exception is vp9_full_pixel_diamond(), however the core diamond
    and refining search routines called from vp9_full_pixel_diamond() also
    return SAD. If variance of pred error + mv cost is desired it must be
    calculated explicitly outside these functions. For very fast encoding,
    hopefully this will eliminate some redundant computations.
    
    Also suggests reimplementing FAST_HEX with the vp9_pattern_search
    framework. It is not exactly the same as the existing FAST_HEX, but
    [1;31mperf[mormance is slightly better and speed is very similar. Enables
    removing a lot of duplicate code.

    Fix potential invalid partition size use
    
    For blocks at frame boundary, the selected block size sometimes needs
    to be smaller than that was first given. This commit forces such block
    size change only between square blocks, so as to avoid the potential
    use case containing 32x16 + 16x8 + 16x8, for 1080p sequences.
    
    Local test suggested no visible coding speed difference. Borg test
    reveals no difference in terms of compression [1;31mperf[mormance.

    Skip some mode SAD calculation in non-RD mode
    
    This commit checks if the motion vector associated with the current
    mode has been computed in previous mode tests. If possible, skip the
    redundant reference block generation and SAD calculation in the
    non-RD mode decision process.
    
    For test sequence pedestrian_area 1080p, the runtime goes from
    24261 ms to 23770 ms. This does not change compression [1;31mperf[mormance.
    The speed-up is mostly around places with consistent motion.

    sub-pixel motion search in NEWMV mode. The compression [1;31mperf[mormance
    gains becomes fairly significant after we enabled sub-pixel accuracy
    motion compensated prediction to calculate SAD cost.
    
    For test sequences pedestrian_area at 1080p and vidyo1 at 720p, the

    Refactor selected partition size coding for rtc
    
    This commit makes a refactoring of the rtc_use_partition. It allows
    the encoder to take a preferred block size for non-RD mode decision.
    The boundary blocks are handled such that smaller block sizes that
    fit in the boundary size will be used instread.
    
    In rtc mode, the coding [1;31mperf[mormance of speed -6 for pedestrian_1080p
    goes from
    158980 b/f, 38.934 dB, 22721 ms to
    159008 b/f, 40.064 dB, 23721 ms.
    
    For rtc set, the speed -6 compression [1;31mperf[mormance is improved by
    26%. Still about 2dB behind speed -5 at this point.

    Enable reduced set of intra modes in rtc coding
    
    This commit enables the use of DC, vertical, and horizontal intra
    prediction mode in rtc non-RD mode decision. When the best cost value
    of inter modes is above a given threshold, the encoder runs the
    above three intra modes and selects the one that has minimum
    prediction residual in terms of SAD.
    
    This together with recent changes on non-RD mode decision and coding

    some of the functions were optimized by processing 32 elements instead of 16.
    some of the functions were optimized by processing 2 loop strides of 16
    elements in a single 256 bit register

    Adaptive motion control on ref and search range
    
    This commit takes a preliminary attempt to refine the motion search
    control. It detects the SAD associated with mv predictor per reference
    frame, and based on which to determine whether the encoder wants to
    reduce the motion search range (if the predicted mv provides fairly
    small SAD), or to skip the current reference frame (if there exists
    another ref frame that gives much smaller SAD cost).
    
    This feature is turned on in the settings of speed 1 and above.

    Full range motion search for regular block sizes
    
    Add a full range motion search for regular block sizes. This runs
    exhaustive search within the given reference area. This commit further
    optimizes the search process by combining 4 points test into one
    pipeline, which gives 30% speed-up as compared to run each individual
    point at a time.
    
    This full range search serves as a best possible motion search reference.
    When replacing the diamond search with full range search, the speed 0
    runtime of bus CIF at 2000 kbps goes from 153872ms to 623051ms. The

    SSSE3 Optimization for Atom processors using new instruction selection and ordering
    
    The function vp9_filter_block1d16_h8_ssse3 uses the PSHUFB instruction which has a 3 cycle latency and slows execution when done in blocks of 5 or more on Atom processors.
    By replacing the PSHUFB instructions with other more efficient single cycle instructions (PUNPCKLBW + PUNPCHBW + PALIGNR) performance can be improved.
    In the original code, the PSHUBF uses every byte and is consecutively copied.
    This is done more efficiently by PUNPCKLBW and PUNPCHBW, using PALIGNR to concatenate the intermediate result and then shift right the next consecutive 16 bytes for the final result.
    
    For example:
    filter = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    Reg = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
    REG1 = PUNPCKLBW Reg, Reg = 0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7
    REG2 = PUNPCHBW Reg, Reg = 8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15
    PALIGNR REG2, REG1, 1 = 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
    
    This [1;31moptim[mization improved the function performance by 23% and produced a 3% user level gain on 1080p content on Atom processors.
    There was no observed performance impact on Core processors (expected).

    Use the RTC [1;31moptim[mizations when in high bitdepth mode.
    
    Change 72193 made the encoder behave differently
    when configured with and without high bitdepth.
    This change means the same algorithm is used for both.

    Remove asm offset dependencies
    
    The obj_int_extract code is no longer worth maintaining. It creates
    significant issues when adapting for different build systems and no
    longer offers as significant of a performance benefit due to
    improvements in intrinsics.
    
    Source files will remain until the various third-party builds are updated.
    
    The neon fast quantizer has been moved to intrinsics. The armv6 version
    has been removed because so few remaining targets require it.
    
    Compilers and processors have improved significantly since the
    pack_tokens code was written. The assembly is no longer faster than the
    C code.
    
    pack_tokens were the only [1;31moptim[mizations for the armv5te targets so the targets
    will be removed after the test infrastructure has been updated.

    Fix SSSE3 partial_idct_test detection
    
    The test filter is not a prefix matcher. It requires test type to
    contain no more than the [1;31moptim[mization type. In this example, SSSE3_64
    fails to match and the test is not skipped even when SSSE3 is not

    Early termination after partition NONE is done in RD.
    
    This patch allows the encoder to skip the search for partition
    SPLIT, HORZ, VERT after the search for partition NONE is done
    in RD [1;31moptim[mization. It uses the first pass block-wise statistics
    to make the decision. If all 16x16 blocks in the current partition
    have zero motions and small residues from the frist pass statistics,
    and it has small difference variance, further partition search is
    skipped.
    
    For speed 2 setting, experiments on general youtube clips show that
    the speedup varies from 1% - 10%, 5% on average. On the performance
    side in PSNR, derf 0.004%, yt -0.059%, hd -0.106%, stdhd 0.032%.

    vp9_rdopt is for making rd [1;31moptim[mal mode decisions. vp9_rd is for all
    other rd related routines. Anything used outside of making an rd [1;31moptim[mal

    AVX2 To VP9 Block Error Optimization
    
    vp9_block_error_sse2 can only handle 16 bytes at a time but
    the function requires to handle a sequence of 32 bytes at a time
    so each 16 bytes is handled in a different register.
    With AVX2 [1;31moptim[mization the 32 bytes can be handled in one register instead
    of two in the SSE2
    The vp9_block_error was [1;31moptim[mized by 85%.
    The user level was [1;31moptim[mized by 1.2%

    Save NEON registers in VP8 NEON functions
    
    The recent compiler can generate [1;31moptim[mized code that uses NEON registers
    for various operations besides floating-point operations. Therefore,
    only saving callee-saved registers d8 - d15 at the beginning of the

    code in VP8 NEON functions that use those registers.

    Apply finer quantizer to partition search frames in non-RD flow
    
    This commit [1;31moptim[mizes the bit allocation for the non-RD coding flow.
    It applies slightly better quantizer to the frames, where all blocks
    run a non-RD partition search. Such frames typically have better
    rate-distortion trade off, thus improving the reconstruction quality
    for next few frames reference at reasonably low increment in rate
    cost.
    
    The coding performance for rtc set at speed -5 with error-resilient
    tuned on and rate control set as cbr is improved by 19.58%. It improved
    the coding speed by about 10% for a portion of local test clips.

    Adds an arbitrary-size resize library for use in scaling of input
    frames in a non-normative manner in the vp9 encoder. The method
    used is as follows:
    Downsampling - Uses a 8 tap filter for factor of 2 decimation upto
    a size just higher than the desired size. Then interpolates pixels
    at a precision of 1/32 pel using a set of 8-tap filters.
    Upsampling - Interpolates pixels at a precision of 1/32 pel using
    a set of 8-tap filters.

    Rework idct8x8_10 SSE2 implementation
    
    This commit [1;31moptim[mizes the SSE2 implmentation of idct8x8_10. It exploits
    the fact that only top-left 4x4 block contains non-zero coefficients,
    and hence reduces the instructions needed.
    
    The runtime of idct8x8_10_sse2 goes down from 216 to 198 CPU cycles,
    estimated by averaging over 100000 runs. For pedestrian_area_1080p 300

    Shorten GF/arf interval in hard scenes.
    
    This patch accounts in the first pass stats for blocks that
    while not coded as intra, are complex and have an intra error /
    best error ratio below a threshold.
    
    The modification shortens the GF arf interval for a particular
    class of content that contains a lot of blocks matching the
    above criteria. (In one short problem test sequence the average
    interval dropped from about 14-15 to 10-11)
    
    The change results in small net gains in metrics results for the
    Yt(~0.2%) and yt-hd (~0.5%) sets and is approximately neutral
    for the other test sets.
    
    The change is currently shielded by a flag and off by default
    pending verification that it does not cause other [1;31mregression[ms
    in tests on a wider YT test set.

    Fix choose_partitioning threshold setup for [1;31mspeed[m -5
    
    The compression performance of [1;31mspeed[m -5 is on average 12.6% better
    than [1;31mspeed[m -6. At lower bit-rates, the gains are typically 20% or
    more. For 2-thread encoding, the [1;31mspeed[m -5 takes about 1.6x time of
    [1;31mspeed[m -6.

    Reduce the number of full block SAD calls
    
    This commit uses a 6-point 1-step refine motion search in the
    integral projection based full pixel motion estimation, to replace
    the current 9-point search.
    
    It reduces runtime cost of [1;31mspeed[m -6 on some noisy clips, e.g.,
    dark720p single thread
    33314 b/f, 40.076 dB, 18231 ms ->
    33307 b/f, 40.067 dB, 17768 ms
    
    The compression performance for rtc set remains unchanged.

    Fix source frame border extension
    
    This commit fixes an issue in source frame border extension. It
    causes certain frame resolution such as 640x480 to have a portion
    of the right/bottom extension filled by zeros, which misleads
    motion search and degrades transform coding performance when large
    block size is used.
    
    This fix improves the [1;31mspeed[m 2 compression performance of a few
    yt sequence, typically ranging from 1% - 2%, up to 5% at median
    to low bit-rate.

    Integral projection based motion estimation
    
    This commit introduces a new block match motion estimation
    using integral projection measurement. The 2-D block and the nearby
    region is projected onto the horizontal and vertical 1-D vectors,
    respectively. It then runs vector match, instead of block match,
    over the two separate 1-D vectors to locate the motion compensated
    reference block.
    
    This process is run per 64x64 block to align the reference before
    choosing partitioning in [1;31mspeed[m 6. The overall CPU cycle cost due
    to this additional 64x64 block match (SSE2 version) takes around 2%
    at low bit-rate rtc [1;31mspeed[m 6. When strong motion activities exist in
    the video sequence, it substantially improves the partition
    selection accuracy, thereby achieving better compression performance
    and lower CPU cycles.
    
    The experiments were tested in RTC [1;31mspeed[m -6 setting:

    Account for chroma component costs in RTC mode decision
    
    This commit allows the encoder to account for additional chroma
    plane costs in the mode decision process, if the current block
    potentially contains significant color change. It improves the
    visual quality at very low bit-rates.
    
    The compression performance of dark720p is improved by 12.39% in
    [1;31mspeed[m 6. For jimred at 150 kbps, the PSNR of V component (red)
    increased by 0.2 dB, at the expense of about 5% increase in
    encoding time. Note that for sequences where the chroma components
    are fairly consistent, the encoding time increase is negligible.
    
    On average the rtc set compression performance is improved by
    1.172% in PSNR and 1.920% in SSIM.

    Try again to merge branch 'frame-parallel' into master branch.
    
    In frame parallel decode, libvpx decoder decodes several frames on all

    Improve motion detection for low complexity regions.
    
    Where there is very subtle motion, especially when combined
    with low spatial complexity, the codec sometimes fails to quickly
    pick up the ambient motion field.
    
    Once it has been established though the field propagates well using
    Nearest and Near MV.
    
    This patch looks specifically at the case where the Nearest and Near
    have not been established as non zero vectors and in this case
    discounts the cost of searching for a new vector in the rd code.
    
    This will almost certainly have some implications in terms of encode
    [1;31mspeed[m but it should be possible to mitigate the impact in a subsequent
    using first pass stats and the local spatial complexity.
    
    Average results for test sets approximately neutral.

    For key frame under variance source partition: 4x4 prediction blocks
    may be selected when variance of 8x8 block is very high (threshold is set fairly high for now).
    
    Testing on some RTC clips shows this helps to reduce some ringing artifacts on key frame.
    Encoded key frame size increases about ~10%. Key frame PSNR increases about ~0.1-0.2dB.

    vp9_ethread: the tile-based multi-threaded encoder
    
    Currently, VP9 supports column-tile encoding, which allows a frame
    to be encoded in multiple column tiles independently. The number of
    column tiles are set by encoder option "--tile-columns". This
    provides a way to encode a frame in parallel.
    
    Based on previous set of patches, this patch implemented the tile-
    based multi-threaded encoder. Each thread processes one or more
    tiles.
    
    Usage:
    For HD clips:
    --tile-columns=2 --threads=1/2/3/4
    
    While using 4 threads, tests showed that the encoder achieved
    2.3X - 2.5X [1;31mspeed[mup at good-quality [1;31mspeed[m 3, and 2X [1;31mspeed[mup at

    Make the spatially adaptive mode search in rate-distortion
    optimization loop inter tile independent. Experiments suggest that
    this does not significantly change the coding staticstics.

    Hybrid partition search for rtc coding mode
    
    This commit re-designs the recursive partition search scheme in
    rtc [1;31mspeed[m -5. It first checks if the current block is under cyclic
    refresh mode. If so, apply recursive partition search. Otherwise,
    perform sub-sampled pixel based partition selection. When the
    pre-selection finds the partition size should be 32x32 or above,
    use the partition size directly. Otherwise, apply partition search
    at nearby levels around the preset partition size.
    
    It is enabled in [1;31mspeed[m -5. The compression performance of rtc
    [1;31mspeed[m -5 is improved by 9.4%. Speed wise, the run-time goes slower
    from 1% to 10%.

    Allow mode search breakout at very low prediction errors
    
    In model_rd_for_sb function, the spatial domain SSE and variance
    are checked to see if transform coefficients are quantized to 0.
    Besides that, this patch adds another set of thresholds that are
    much more strict. These thresholds are used to conduct a partition
    block level check to measure if all its TX blocks are skippable
    for YUV planes. If it is true, x->skip is set for this partition
    block, and thus its mode search is terminated.
    
    This [1;31mspeed[ms up the encoding at very low prediction error case,
    such as screen sharing application. This patch covers what
    rd_encode_breakout_test() does, so that function is removed.
    
    Borg test at [1;31mspeed[m 3 shows:
    For stdhd set, psnr: +0.008%, ssim: +0.014%;
    For derf set, psnr: +0.018%, ssim: +0.025%.

    Add SSE2 code and unit test for VP9 denoiser.
    
    This SSE2 is based on VP8 denoiser's SSE2 code. In VP8, there are

    Early termination in encoding partition search
    
    In the partition search, the encoder checks all possible
    partitionings in the superblock's partition search tree.
    This patch proposed a set of criteria for partition search
    early termination, which effectively decided whether or
    not to terminate the search in current branch based on the
    "skippable" result of the quantized transform coefficients.
    The "skippable" information was gathered during the
    partition mode search, and no overhead calculations were
    introduced.
    
    This patch gives significant encoding [1;31mspeed[m gains without
    sacrificing the quality.

    Add early termination in transform size search
    
    In the full-rd transform size search, we go through all transform

    the search starts from largest transform size, then goes down to
    smallest size.

    Add a [1;31mspeed[m feature to give the tighter search range
    
    Add a [1;31mspeed[m feature to give the tighter partition search
    range. Before partition search, calculate the histogram
    of the partition sizes of the left, above and previous
    co-located blocks of the current block. If the variance of
    observed partition sizes is small enough, adjust the search
    range around the mean partition size, which will be tigher.
    
    The feature is currently turned on at [1;31mspeed[m 2. Experiments on
    sample youtube clips show on average the runtime is reduced
    by 3-7%.

    Directly split the block in partition search
    
    This patch allows the encoder to directly split the block
    in partition search, therefore skip searching NONE. It
    computes a score which measures whether 16x16 motion vectors
    from the first pass in the current block are consistent with
    each others. If they are inconsistent and we have enough Q
    to encode, split the block directly, and skip searching NONE.
    
    This feature is under flag CONFIG_FP_MB_STATS. In [1;31mspeed[m 2,
    it further gives a [1;31mspeed[mup of 3-8% on sample yt clips as
    compared to the previous version under the same flag. Overall,
    the features under the flag will give 7-15% on typical yt
    clips at up to 6000kbps data rate. The [1;31mspeed[mup at very high
    data rate is not significant.
    
    For hard stdhd clips:
    park_joy_1080p @ 15000kbps:       504541ms -> 506293ms (-0.35%)
    pedestrian_area_1080p @ 2000kbps: 326610ms -> 290090ms (+11.2%)
    
    The compression performance using the features under the flag:
    derf: -0.068%
    yt:   -0.189%
    hd:   -0.318%
    stdhd:-0.183%
    
    To use the feature, set CONFIG_FP_MB_STATS and turn on
    cpi->use_fp_mb_stats.

    Early termination after partition NONE is done in RD.
    
    This patch allows the encoder to skip the search for partition
    SPLIT, HORZ, VERT after the search for partition NONE is done
    in RD optimization. It uses the first pass block-wise statistics
    to make the decision. If all 16x16 blocks in the current partition
    have zero motions and small residues from the frist pass statistics,
    and it has small difference variance, further partition search is
    skipped.
    
    For [1;31mspeed[m 2 setting, experiments on general youtube clips show that
    the [1;31mspeed[mup varies from 1% - 10%, 5% on average. On the performance
    side in PSNR, derf 0.004%, yt -0.059%, hd -0.106%, stdhd 0.032%.

    Chessboard pattern partition search
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern constrained partition
    search for 720p and above resolutions. The scheme applies stricter
    partition search to alternative blocks based on its above/left
    neighboring blocks' partition range, as well as that of the
    collocated blocks in the previous frame. It is currently turned
    on at 16x16 block size level. The chessboard pattern is flipped
    per coding frame.
    
    The [1;31mspeed[m 3 runtime is reduced:
    park_joy_1080p, 652832 ms -> 607738 ms (7% [1;31mspeed[m-up)
    pedestrian_area_1080p, 215998 ms -> 200589 ms (8% [1;31mspeed[m-up)

    Elevate NEWMV mode checking threshold in real time
    
    The current threshold is knid of low, and in many cases NEWMV
    mode is checked but not picked as the best mode. This patch
    added a [1;31mspeed[m feature to increase NEWMV threshold, so that
    less partition mode checking goes to check NEWMV. This feature
    is enabled for [1;31mspeed[m 6 and 7.
    
    Rtc set borg tests showed:
    1. Speed 6, overall psnr: -0.088%, ssim: -1.339%;
       Average [1;31mspeed[mup on rtc set is 11.1%.
    2. Speed 7, overall psnr: -0.505%, ssim: -2.320%
       Average [1;31mspeed[mup on rtc set is 12.9%.

    Enable encode breakout in real time
    
    For real time [1;31mspeed[m 7, once encode breakout is on(i.e. encoding
    setting --static-thresh=1), a proper encode breakout threshold
    is set to [1;31mspeed[m up the encoder.
    
    Set --static-thresh=1, RTC set borg test showed a slight overall
    psnr loss of 0.162%, but ssim gain of 0.287%. The average [1;31mspeed[mup
    on RTC set is 6%, and for some clips, the [1;31mspeed[mup can be 10+%.

    Decide the partitioning threshold from the variance histogram
    
    Before encoding a frame, calculate and store each 16x16 block's
    variance of source difference between last and current frame.
    Find partitioning threshold T for the frame from its variance
    histogram, and then use T to make partition decisions.
    
    Comparing with fixed 16x16 partitioning, rtc set test showed an
    overall psnr gain of 3.242%, and ssim gain of 3.751%. The best
    psnr gain is 8.653%.
    
    The overall encoding [1;31mspeed[m didn't change much. It got faster for
    some clips(for example, 12% [1;31mspeed[mup for vidyo1), and a little
    slower for others.
    
    Also, a minor modification was made in datarate unit test.

    This commit enables an adaptive transform size selection method
    for [1;31mspeed[m -6. It uses largest transform size when the sse is more
    than 4 times of variance, i.e., most energy is compacted in the
    DC coefficient. Otherwise, use the default TX_8X8. It improves
    the compression efficiency for rtc set of [1;31mspeed[m -6 by 0.8%, no

    Skip the partition search for the frame with no motion
    
    This patch allows the encoder to skip the partition search for the
    frame if it is an inter frame and only zero motion vectors have
    been detected in the first pass. The partition size is directly
    assigned according to the difference variance.
    
    Borg tests show overall little performance changes in term of PSNR
    (derf -0.027%, yt 0.152%, hd 0.078%, stdhd 0%). The worst case of
    PSNR loss is -0.514% from yt. The best PSNR gain is 4.293% from yt.
    The second pass encoding [1;31mspeed[mup for slideshow clips is 15%-40%.

    Enable real-time version reference motion vector search
    
    This commit enables a fast reference motion vector search scheme.
    It checks the nearest top and left neighboring blocks to decide the
    most probable predicted motion vector. If it finds the two have
    the same motion vectors, it then skip finding exterior range for
    the second most probable motion vector, and correspondingly skips
    the check for NEARMV.

    of 0,0 motion using the last source frame as the reference,
    and skips the further motion search if this error is small.

    Enable SSSE3 inverse 2D-DCT with 10 non-zero coeffs
    
    This commit enables SSSE3 implementation of the inverse 2D-DCT
    with only first 10 coefficients non-zero. It reduces the runtime
    of SSE2 version from 745 cycles to 538 cycles, i.e., 27% [1;31mspeed[m-up.

    Use offset mode info when filling pc tree.
    
    Use the appropriate subblock offset mode info rather than the parent
    block base, when filling mbmi in the pc tree in nonrd_use_partition.
    This mimics what is done in the vertical case and what is done for
    both cases in nonrd_pick_partition.
    
    This change has little practical effect at the moment since in [1;31mspeed[m 5
    rt horizontal and vertical partitions are currently only used unpaired

    Enable various thresholds of motion detection
    
    This commit changed to enable the encoder to adjust motion dection
    [1;31mspeed[m threshold based on picture size. In addition, cpu-used 1 now
    does a partition search every other frame instead of every third
    frame for low resolution inputs.
    
    The change has no quality/[1;31mspeed[m impact for 720p and above. Test
    showed the change increase encoding time by between 3% to 6% for
    cpu-used 2 encodiong of 360p sequences. It also has a compression
    gain about .3%.
    
    For cpu-used 2, the change resolved some very disturbing visual
    artifacts in certain sequences when large block partitionings and
    transforms are used as a result of copying the partition from a
    previous frame.

    Apply constrained partition search range to non-RD mode decision
    
    This commit enables a chessboard pattern for partition search. All
    the black blocks run regular partition search ranging from 8x8 to

    to adaptively decide the effective search range.
    
    The compression performance for rtc set at [1;31mspeed[m -5 is down by 1.5%.
    For pedestrian 1080p at [1;31mspeed[m -5, the runtime goes from 41594 ms to

    Enable background detection for adaptive quantizer control
    
    This commit enables a background detection approach for adaptive
    quantizer control. It combines the cyclic refresh pattern and the
    background information to determine the segment id for adaptive
    quantizer selection, prior to the non-RD mode decision process.
    It hence allows proper quantization information update for a more
    precise rate-distortion modeling in the non-RD mode decision.
    
    The compression performance of [1;31mspeed[m -5 for rtc set is improved
    by 2.5%, at no [1;31mspeed[m change.

    Apply finer quantizer to partition search frames in non-RD flow
    
    This commit optimizes the bit allocation for the non-RD coding flow.
    It applies slightly better quantizer to the frames, where all blocks
    run a non-RD partition search. Such frames typically have better
    rate-distortion trade off, thus improving the reconstruction quality
    for next few frames reference at reasonably low increment in rate
    cost.
    
    The coding performance for rtc set at [1;31mspeed[m -5 with error-resilient
    tuned on and rate control set as cbr is improved by 19.58%. It improved
    the coding [1;31mspeed[m by about 10% for a portion of local test clips.

    Further [1;31mspeed[m trade off adjustments.
    
    Small [1;31mspeed[m gain for [1;31mspeed[m 1.
    
    Quality is generally a little up for [1;31mspeed[m 2.
    
    Speed 3 was similar to [1;31mspeed[m 4 but now positioned more
    evenly between 2 and 4 [1;31mspeed[m and quality wise.
       (opsnr +5.6% ssim +8.25% across all sets)
    
    Speed 4 is a little slower than before but sizable quality gains.
       (opsnr +3.7% ssim +6.8% across all sets)
    
    The code has been cleaned up a bit so that for each incremental
    [1;31mspeed[m step changes over the previous [1;31mspeed[m step are applied.

    Motion referenced partition search for non-RD coding flow
    
    This commit enables the non-RD mode decision coding flow to
    adaptively apply partition search in non-refresh frame, when the
    collocated block in previous frame suggests there might be a motion
    activity. It refactors the update_state_rt() function to support
    buffer swap of mode_info struct, thereby unifying the encoding
    stage across various non-RD coding modes.
    
    It provides 5% compression performance gains in [1;31mspeed[m -6 for rtc
    test set, at about 12% [1;31mspeed[m slow down.

    Enable variable block size test in non-RD mode decision
    
    This is an initial attempt to allow variable block size partition
    in non-RD coding flow. It tests 8x8, 16x16 and 32x32 block size per
    64x64 block, all using non-RD mode decision and the associated rate
    distortion costs from modeling, then selects the best block size to
    encode the entire 64x64 block. Such operations are triggered every
    other 3 frames. The blocks of intermediate frames will reuse the
    collocated block's partition type.
    
    It improves the compression performance by 13.2%. Note that the gains
    are not evenly distributed. For many hard clips, the compression
    performance is improved by 20% to 28%. Local [1;31mspeed[m test shows that

    Preliminary code for variance based paritioning
    
    Brings back most of Jim's previous patch for choosing

    Use modeled rate distortion costs for non-RD mode
    
    This commit replaces SAD cost with modeled rate-distortion cost
    for non-RD mode decision. It translates the prediction residual
    SSE into estimate rate and reconstruction distorion costs, hence
    capturing the quantization setting effect. The compression
    performance of [1;31mspeed[m -7 for rtc set is improved by 14.79%.

    Refactoring motion search libs
    
    The core motion estimation fucntions all return sad now consistently.
    The only exception is vp9_full_pixel_diamond(), however the core diamond
    and refining search routines called from vp9_full_pixel_diamond() also
    return SAD. If variance of pred error + mv cost is desired it must be
    calculated explicitly outside these functions. For very fast encoding,
    hopefully this will eliminate some redundant computations.
    
    Also suggests reimplementing FAST_HEX with the vp9_pattern_search
    framework. It is not exactly the same as the existing FAST_HEX, but
    performance is slightly better and [1;31mspeed[m is very similar. Enables
    removing a lot of duplicate code.

    Refines variance based partitioning search
    
    Instead of using source variance, this patch uses variance of the

    Refactor selected partition size coding for rtc
    
    This commit makes a refactoring of the rtc_use_partition. It allows
    the encoder to take a preferred block size for non-RD mode decision.
    The boundary blocks are handled such that smaller block sizes that
    fit in the boundary size will be used instread.
    
    In rtc mode, the coding performance of [1;31mspeed[m -6 for pedestrian_1080p
    goes from

    Use fast HEX search in real time mode
    
    In good quality mode motion search, the best matches are normally
    found after searching in a large area. In real time mode, to make
    encoding fast, a center-biased fast HEX search is used, which
    converges quickly most of the time. A 4-point diamond search is
    also carried out as the following refining search, which gives more
    precise results, and maintains good motion search quality.
    
    At [1;31mspeed[m 5, the borg test on rtc set showed an overall PSNR loss of
    0.936%. The encoding [1;31mspeed[m gain is 4% - 5%.

    Remove some cases for turning off arf.
    
    Flipping arf on and off too often is hurting some clips.
    This change makes no difference for 50-75% of our test
    clips but helps some by a big margin. (eg. std-hd crew
    by 6% and one of the YT and YT-hd clips by 14%)
    
    Average improvements for 2 pass, [1;31mspeed[m 2 (psnr,ssim)
    are as follows:-
    
    derf  0.165%, 0.210%
    yt  1.210%, 1.464%
    yt-hd 1.189%, 1.471%
    std-hd 1.031%, 0.886%

    Enable encode_breakout in real time encoding
    
    In real time encoding, we enable encode_breakout to make encoding
    fast. A [1;31mspeed[m feature "use_encode_breakout" is defined to set
    encode_breakout thresholds for different [1;31mspeed[ms.
    
    However, currently, static_thresh is an encoder option. The encode_
    breakout can be turned off if user sets static_thresh=0 specifically.

    vp9 decoder: row-based multi-threaded loopfilter
    
    Implemented parallel loopfiltering, which uses existing tile-
    decoding threads. Each thread works on one row, and when that row
    is loopfiltered, it moves to next unattended row. To ensure the
    correct filtering order, threads are synchronized and one
    superblock is filtered only if the superblocks it depends on are
    filtered already.
    
    To reduce synchronization overhead and [1;31mspeed[m up the decoder, we use
    nsync > 1 for high resolution.
    
    Performance tests:
    1. on desktop:
    8-tile 4k video using 8 threads, [1;31mspeed[mup: 70% - 80%
    4-tile HD video using 4 threads, [1;31mspeed[mup: ~35%

    create super fast rtc mode
    
    This patch only works if the video is a width and height that are both
    a multiple of 32..   It sets every partition to 16x16, and does INTRADC
    only on the first frame and ZEROMV on every other frame.   It always does
    does the largest possible transform, and loop filter level is set to 4.
    
    Was ~20% faster than [1;31mspeed[m -5 of vp8
    
    Now 20% slower but adds motion search ( every block ), nearest, near
    and zeromv
    
    The SVC test was changed because - while this realtime mode produces
    bad quality albeit quickly, it isn't obeying all the rules it should
    about which frames are available.

    Optimze inv 16x16 DCT with 10 non-zero coeffs - P1
    
    This commit is the first patch optimizing SSE2 implementation of inverse
    16x16 DCT with <10 non-zero coefficients. It focused on the first 1-D (row)
    transformation. It exploits the fact that only top-left 4x4 block contains
    non-zero coefficients, in a 2-D inverse 16x16 DCT with <10 coeffients.
    
    The average runtime of idct16x16_10 unit is reduced from
    883 cycles -> 779 cycles (12% faster).
    
    For pedestrian_area_1080p 300 frames at 4000 kbps, the [1;31mspeed[m 2 runtime goes
    down from 310651 ms  -> 305910 ms. The decoding [1;31mspeed[m goes up from

    Remove avoid_frame_with_high_error from RD loop
    
    The feature undergoes prior assumption that the recursive partition
    size search from 4x4 to 64x64, hence utilizing information from small
    blocks to determine early termination in large block rate-distortion
    optimization search. The current codebase is now going from top down.
    The previous function might go with not properly initialized values,
    hence removed.
    
    Tested on pedestrian_area_1080p at 4000 kbps running under [1;31mspeed[m 2.
    No visible difference in runtime observed.

    Rework idct8x8_10 SSE2 implementation
    
    This commit optimizes the SSE2 implmentation of idct8x8_10. It exploits
    the fact that only top-left 4x4 block contains non-zero coefficients,
    and hence reduces the instructions needed.
    
    The runtime of idct8x8_10_sse2 goes down from 216 to 198 CPU cycles,
    estimated by averaging over 100000 runs. For pedestrian_area_1080p 300
    frames coded at 4000kbps, the average decoding [1;31mspeed[m goes up from
    79.3 fps to 79.7 fps.

    Adaptive motion control on ref and search range
    
    This commit takes a preliminary attempt to refine the motion search
    control. It detects the SAD associated with mv predictor per reference
    frame, and based on which to determine whether the encoder wants to
    reduce the motion search range (if the predicted mv provides fairly
    small SAD), or to skip the current reference frame (if there exists
    another ref frame that gives much smaller SAD cost).

    Account for chroma component costs in RTC mode decision
    
    This commit allows the encoder to account for additional chroma
    plane costs in the mode decision process, if the current block
    potentially contains significant color change. It improves the
    visual [1;31mquality[m at very low bit-rates.
    
    The compression performance of dark720p is improved by 12.39% in
    speed 6. For jimred at 150 kbps, the PSNR of V component (red)
    increased by 0.2 dB, at the expense of about 5% increase in
    encoding time. Note that for sequences where the chroma components
    are fairly consistent, the encoding time increase is negligible.
    
    On average the rtc set compression performance is improved by
    1.172% in PSNR and 1.920% in SSIM.

    Adjust active maxq for GF groups.

    In this patch the active max Q is adjusted for each GF
    group based on the vbr bit allocation and raw first pass

    sections where [1;31mquality[m issues have been reported.

    Multiframe Quality Enhancement(MFQE) in VP9.
    
    It is the first version of MFQE in VP9. There are a few TODOs included
    in this version.
    Usage: Add flag --enable-vp9-postproc to config the project.
    In decoder, use flag --mfqe in the command line to enable
    MFQE in postproc.
    Note: Need to have key frame with low [1;31mquality[m to see the effect of this
    new patch. In my experiment, I fixed the qindex to 200 in key frame.

    vp9_ethread: the tile-based multi-threaded encoder
    
    Currently, VP9 supports column-tile encoding, which allows a frame
    to be encoded in multiple column tiles independently. The number of
    column tiles are set by encoder option "--tile-columns". This
    provides a way to encode a frame in parallel.
    
    Based on previous set of patches, this patch implemented the tile-
    based multi-threaded encoder. Each thread processes one or more
    tiles.
    
    Usage:
    For HD clips:
    --tile-columns=2 --threads=1/2/3/4
    
    While using 4 threads, tests showed that the encoder achieved
    2.3X - 2.5X speedup at good-[1;31mquality[m speed 3, and 2X speedup at
    realtime speed 5.

    For key frame at speed 6: enable the non-rd mode selection in speed setting

    Adjust some logic/thresholds in variance partition selection for key frame only (no change to delta frames),

    Allow update of golden refernce buffer in CBR mode
    
    This commit changes to allow the usage of golden reference frame in
    VP9 CBR mode to improve [1;31mquality[m. VP9 supports potentially up to 8
    reference buffers, it has reference buffers available for this
    purpose. This was not possible in VP8 as golden and alt-ref buffers
    were used for temporal scalability purpose in CBR mode in WebRTC.
    
    For frames that update golden frame, there can be a [1;31mquality[m boost.
    The amount of allowed bitrate boost can be controlled via parameter
    rc_max_inter_bitrate_pct. The inital value of the boost ratior is
    currently based on over_shoot_pct. Further experiments will work
    out the adaption of this boost value.

    Early termination in encoding partition search
    
    In the partition search, the encoder checks all possible
    partitionings in the superblock's partition search tree.
    This patch proposed a set of criteria for partition search
    early termination, which effectively decided whether or
    not to terminate the search in current branch based on the
    "skippable" result of the quantized transform coefficients.
    The "skippable" information was gathered during the
    partition mode search, and no overhead calculations were
    introduced.
    
    This patch gives significant encoding speed gains without
    sacrificing the [1;31mquality[m.

    Use small transform size in non-rd real-time mode
    
    In non-rd real-time mode, choosing smaller transform size in
    encoding gives better video [1;31mquality[m and good speed gain than
    choosing larger transform size. This patch set tx size search
    method to ALLOW_8X8, which is better than using 4x4 or other
    larger sizes.
    
    Borg tests on rtc set at speed 6 showed significant gain on [1;31mquality[m.
    PSNR gain: 11.034% and SSIM gain: 15.466%.
    
    The speed gain is 5% - 12% for <720p clips, and 2% - 7% for
    720p clips.

    If we are already saving a lot in bits from the target (maximum)
    bitrate in the constrained [1;31mquality[m mode, allow the quantizer
    to go lower than the cq level. This hopefully will solve issues

    Enable various thresholds of motion detection
    
    This commit changed to enable the encoder to adjust motion dection
    speed threshold based on picture size. In addition, cpu-used 1 now
    does a partition search every other frame instead of every third
    frame for low resolution inputs.
    
    The change has no [1;31mquality[m/speed impact for 720p and above. Test
    showed the change increase encoding time by between 3% to 6% for
    cpu-used 2 encodiong of 360p sequences. It also has a compression
    gain about .3%.
    
    For cpu-used 2, the change resolved some very disturbing visual
    artifacts in certain sequences when large block partitionings and
    transforms are used as a result of copying the partition from a
    previous frame.

    Use fast HEX search in real time mode
    
    In good [1;31mquality[m mode motion search, the best matches are normally
    found after searching in a large area. In real time mode, to make
    encoding fast, a center-biased fast HEX search is used, which
    converges quickly most of the time. A 4-point diamond search is
    also carried out as the following refining search, which gives more
    precise results, and maintains good motion search [1;31mquality[m.
    
    At speed 5, the borg test on rtc set showed an overall PSNR loss of
    0.936%. The encoding speed gain is 4% - 5%.

    Add max burst bitrate control.
    
    Applies an upper limit on burst bitrate for any
    frame. This is to insure that typical encodes for YT
    do not produce frames that are so large that they
    risk stalling HW implementations. Such frames
    could also cause playback problems in SW.
    
    For now the limit is set at 250 bits per MB for 1080P
    and larger (with the 1080P limit used for smaller frames).
    
    Setting maxQ, constant [1;31mquality[m mode or targeting a
    very high bandwidth will have precedence over this limit.

    Enable skipping reference frame check in rd loop
    
    This commit allows encoder to compare the SAD cost associated with
    the best motion vector predictor, per frame. If one reference frame
    has this cost more than 4 times of the best SAD cost given by other
    reference frames, skip NEARESTMV, NEARMV, ZEROMV mode check of this
    reference frame.

    Further rate control cleanups
    
    Includes various cleanups.
    Streamlines the interfaces so that all rate control state
    updates happen in the vp9_rc_postencode_update() function.
    This will hopefully make it easier to support multiple

    Removes some unnecessary code, which in rare cases can casue
    a difference in the constrained [1;31mquality[m mode output, but
    other than that there is no bitstream change yet.

    vp9_ethread: the tile-based multi-threaded encoder
    
    Currently, VP9 supports [1;31mcolumn[m-tile encoding, which allows a frame
    to be encoded in multiple [1;31mcolumn[m tiles independently. The number of
    [1;31mcolumn[m tiles are set by encoder option "--tile-[1;31mcolumn[ms". This
    provides a way to encode a frame in parallel.
    
    Based on previous set of patches, this patch implemented the tile-
    based multi-threaded encoder. Each thread processes one or more
    tiles.
    
    Usage:
    For HD clips:
    --tile-[1;31mcolumn[ms=2 --threads=1/2/3/4
    
    While using 4 threads, tests showed that the encoder achieved
    2.3X - 2.5X speedup at good-quality speed 3, and 2X speedup at
    realtime speed 5.

    Fix decoder resolution change with tiles
    
    There was a bug with the decoder that if you started the decoder
    with more threads than the first frame had tile [1;31mcolumn[ms. Afterwards
    tried to decode a frame with more tile [1;31mcolumn[ms than the first frame,
    the decoder would hang. E.g. run vpxdec --threads=4. The first frame
    had two tile [1;31mcolumn[ms, then the next key frame had 4 tile [1;31mcolumn[ms, the
    decoder would hang. If you started with 4 tiles and switched to 2
    tiles the decoder would be fine. The issue is that the worker the thread
    loop is using is stale.
    
    I added a test vector "vp90-2-14-resize-848x480-1280x720.webm" that
    exhibited the bug.
