    Inverse bazel project/workspace tree (#677)
    
    * Inverse bazel workspace tree.
    
    Now each subproject directly depends on root (c) project.
    
    This helps to mitigate Bazel bug bazelbuild/bazel#2391; short summary:
    Bazel does not work if referenced subproject `WORKSPACE` uses any
    repositories that embedding project does not.
    
    Bright side: building C project is much faster;
    no need to download closure, go and JDK...
