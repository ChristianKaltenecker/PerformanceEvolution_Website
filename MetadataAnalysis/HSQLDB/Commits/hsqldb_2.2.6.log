    Added much detail to dependency-specification section
    
    This should save application integrators a ton of time.

    Restored better Gradle file nesting, this time for mvn-pub.gradle.
    These two commits result in less unnecessary code evaluation and simpler command lines.

    Due to complicated Ant scoping, the -ivy-setup target was executing superfluously many times, just when executed via direct Ant invocation.
    Performed extra Ivy resolves plus really cluttered build screen output.
    This work eliminates the superflous executions.

    Made temporary change to how build-dist.gradle is nested
    
    This is to work around problem due to combination of HyperSQL's unconventional
    decision to not perform builds in the project root directory, Gradle's
    temporary (pre-1.0-version) requirements for setting project name.
    These changes need to be committed before they can be tested by a
    distribution build, so adjustment commits may come shortly.

    Fixed several mistakes with skip properties, both internal and external, so
    that now Docbook gen dependsets and explicit skipping are working perfectly,
    greatly speeding up developer doc rebuilds and partial doc builds.
    Finalized public Gradle task list (have not done dist targets yet).
    Gradle and Ant both working perfeclty for Docbook building now AFAIK.

    Enhanced 'gradlew tasks --all' emulation to point where it is very consistent with OOTB but much more useful.
    Just need Gradle team support for bug GRADLE-1828 to make this perfect.
